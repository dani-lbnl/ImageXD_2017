# Welcome to ImageXD 2017 - exercise using Azure

This [site](https://dani-lbnl.github.io/imagexd2017/) provides explanations and links to the image files needed for Azure-centric activities led by Vani Mandava, Director, Data Science Outreach at Microsoft Research.

## What: 
Classify abstract samples into 2 classes

Dataset consists of two classes, containg 2,000 files each, separated in 2 folders (bcc and hcpnone). Each file represents a sample obtained from simulation of a scattering pattern, which produces an image that can be very abstract to non-beamline scientists. 

## Where: 
Activities will happen at University of Washington.

## When: 
This exercise will allow practice during ImageXD-2017 core program.

## Who: 
All of those who want to use real image data to train machine learning models using Azure tools.
